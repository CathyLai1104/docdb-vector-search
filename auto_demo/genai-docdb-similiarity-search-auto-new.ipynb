    "In this notebook, we'll build the core components of a textually similar Products. Often people don't know what exactly they are looking for and in that case they just type an item description and hope it will retrieve similar items.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core components of searching textually similar items is a fixed length sentence/word embedding i.e. a  “feature vector” that corresponds to that text. The reference word/sentence embedding typically are generated offline and must be stored so they can be efficiently searched. In this use case we are using Amazon Bedrock Titan(https://aws.amazon.com/cn/bedrock/titan/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable efficient searches for textually similar items, we'll use Amazon Bedrock Titan to generate fixed length sentence embeddings i.e “feature vectors” and use the Nearest Neighbor search in Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) using the Vector Search. DocumentDB Vector Search lets you store and search for points in vector space and find the \"nearest neighbors\" for those points. Use cases include recommendations (for example, an \"other songs you might like\" feature in a music application), image recognition, and fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps we'll follow to build textually similar items: After some initial setup, we'll call Bedrock Titan Embedding model. Then generate feature vectors for Auto products from the website(https://mechanicbase.com/cars/different-car-models-types) dataset. Those feature vectors will be stored in DocumentDB Vector Search vector datatype. Next, we'll explore some sample text queries, and visualize the results."

It supports exact and approximate nearest neighbor search, L2 distance, inner product, and cosine distance.\n",
